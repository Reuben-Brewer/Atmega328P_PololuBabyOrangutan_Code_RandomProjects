V = IR

0.25W = I^2R
I = SQRT(0.25W/8OHM) = 0.177AMPS

5V = (0.5*0.177AMPS)*(R + 8HOMS)
R = 5V/(0.5*0.177AMPS) - 8OHMS = 48.6OHMS FOR A FACTOR OF SAFETY OF 2

R = 12V/(0.90*0.177AMPS) - 8OHMS = 127.6OHMS 67OHMs


35mA limit on each io pin for baby orangutan...

R = 5V/(35mA) - 8Ohms = 134ohms

if we use a 150ohm resistor, then we'll only draw 31mA
